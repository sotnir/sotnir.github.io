                        <h2>What is SOTNIR?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">SOTNIR stands for Southampton Neuroimaging Repository.</p>

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p class="lead">The purpose of establishing SOTNIR is to make 
                            it easier to carry out high-quality neuroimaging research at Southampton. This is an initiative 
                            between UoS Faculty of Medicine and UHS Imaging Physics Group, but it is important to note that 
                            the ever-growing Southampton neuroimaging community spans multiple faculties and disciplines 
                            across the UoS and the UHS, therefore, having an infrastructure that allows the storage, management, 
                            and sharing of neuroimaging data, software, and protocols represents a genuine priority. SOTNIR aims 
                            to be a collaborative platform to enable this, where on-going communications are taking place between 
                            scientists and engineers who work in academic or clinical settings. In addition, SOTNIR advocates 
                            sharing neuroimage processing software that are well developed, tested, and documented, so that the 
                            risks related to clinical applications are well managed, and people coming from different backgrounds 
                            know how to use them.</p>

                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <p class="lead">The benefit of SOTNIR is multi-folds. Locally, researchers can increase the uptake of 
                            projects for publication and funding applications, students can access standardized workflows to 
                            carry out short-term projects and fulfill curriculum. Globally, SOTNIR fosters positive interactions 
                            with external collaborators and the broader scientific community, enabling re-analysis and meta-analysis 
                            of the data in different contexts1, thus presenting a collective effort towards transparent and reproducible 
                            science. Many neuroimaging repositories have been made publicly available2–8, covering a wide spectrum of 
                            imaging modality, population, and study design. Therefore, establishing SOTNIR is not innovative, but fundamental, 
                            for enabling Southampton neuroimaging research to continue expanding, a commitment that the UoS and the UHS 
                            has made significant investment.</p>

                        <p class="lead">In brief, SOTNIR consists of two components: one that hosts data, and the other that hosts software and protocols: </p>
                        <ol clas="lead">
                            <li><i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xnat.org/">eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT)</a></i> is a platform that can store, 
                                manage, and share neuroimaging data. XNAT has been widely implemented for different projects around the world, 
                                such as NITRC<sup>2</sup>, VUIIS<sup>3</sup>, NUNDA<sup>4</sup>, ConnectomeDB<sup>5</sup>, SchizConnect<sup>7</sup>, 
                                and the Dementia Platform UK<sup>9</sup>.</li>
                            <li><i><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></i> primarily hosts and provides version control of source code, 
                                and GitHub is a “social coding platform” where software developers and researchers can exchange ideas and collaborate on codes<sup>10</sup>. 
                                GitHub allows automated testing, so that new codes can be continuously integrated with existing codes to be well maintained<sup>10</sup>. 
                                GitHub has been extensively used in neuroimaging community, an example is the 
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dipy">Diffusion Imaging in Python (DIPY)</a><sup>11</sup>. 
                                DIPY uses a “public code review” model to maintain high-quality code, where everyone is given 
                                a chance to comment and raise questions on proposed contribution before the new code is merged<sup>11</sup>.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Users</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Individuals that interact with SOTNIR can be grouped into four types:</p>
                        <ul class="lead">
                            <li>UoS users</li>
                            <li>UHS users</li>
                            <li>External collaborators</li>
                            <li>General users from the broader scientific community</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Routes</h3>
                        <p class="lead">There are two routes that individuals may choose from to interact with SOTNIR: </p>
                        <ol class="lead">
                            <li><i>Web user interface</i>: A subdomain can be applied to host a SOTNIR website at UoS. 
                                The website provides a user-friendly interface, where users can navigate and perform query, 
                                e.g. search for datasets of certain modality and format (see NITRC<sup>2</sup>). 
                                In addition, the website can post education resources, such as courses on campus and online workshops. 
                                Opportunities for doing research, and research studies that are looking for participants can also be 
                                posted on the website.</li>
                            <li><i>High-performance computing resources</i>: This usually has a command-line interface. An example would be Iridis 5, 
                                a supercomputer housed at UoS. Iridis 5 has more than 20,000 processor cores and a peak of over 1 Petaflop/s, 
                                along with 2.5Pb of online storage and 10Pb of deep offline storage. Bespoke software and pipelines can be cloned from 
                                SOTNIR to Iridis 5 to process and analyze datasets.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>

                        <h3>Data storage, management, an sharing</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Data to be archived at XNAT must first undergo in-house anonymization process to protect sensitive 
                            information of study participants. Data sharing needs to be in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation, 
                            this is currently a work in progress by the UHS Medical Device Software Group (MDSG). 
                            Access to XNAT is restricted to users authorized by specific study's investigators.</p>

                        <h3>Software management, processing pipelines, and documentation</h3>
                        <p class="lead">The UHS MDSG has recognized expertise in Quality Management System. MDSG can support the development of 
                            neuroimage processing software and pipelines for clinical applications, including those research tools that may be translated 
                            to clinical settings. Documentation of software and pipelines can be hosted at Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org/), 
                            a platform that has a user-friendly interface and integrates well with GitHub.</p>
